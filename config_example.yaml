### Input data ###
##################

# The gene tree forest to correct: a single file with trees in the .nhx format
## Remove or comment the `trees` entry below to build starting trees with TreeBeST instead ##
# Trees should be separated by '//'
# .nhx tags at internal nodes should have the `D` attribute for duplication/speciation (D=Y or D=N)
# .nhx tags at leaves should have the `S` attribute to indicate the species to which the gene belongs
# Optionally, DD and DCS can help flag dubious duplication at internal nodes DD=Y or DCS=0 for dubious duplications
# SCORPiOs is more suited to correct species tree aware gene trees
trees: data/example/forest.nhx


# The corresponding multiple alignments: a single file with alignments in the fasta format
# The file can be gzipped (.gz) or not
# These should be nucleotide alignments (CDS back-translated protein alignments)
# Alignments should be separated by '//'
# They should appear in the same order as their corresponding tree in the forest
# Gene names should be the same as in the trees
alis: data/example/ali.fa.gz


## Uncomment the `genes_sp_mapping` entry below to build starting trees with TreeBeST ##
# Genes - species mapping file : a single file with two columns: gene_name species name
# Families should be separated by '//'
# They should appear in the same order as their corresponding alignment in the alignments file
# Gene names and species should be the same as in the alignment and species tree, respectively
#genes_sp_mapping: data/example/genes_sp_mapping.txt


# The genes coordinate files for all duplicated species and outgroup(s) to use in synteny analyses
# Two formats are accepted (files can be bzipped2):
# Either a minimal bed with 4 columns: chromosome start end gene_name
# Or a DYOGEN file with 5 or 6 columns: chromosome start end strand gene_name (transcript)
# If in DYOGEN format a line `genes_format: 'dyogen'` should be added
# Gene names should be the same as in the trees and alignments
genes: data/example/genes/genes.%s.bed


# The species tree in newick format with ancestors as internal node names
# It should contain all species in the gene tree forest (marked by the `S` attribute in gene trees)
# Species name should not contain underscores '_'
# For better trees reconstruction with TreeBeST, the tree should not contain polytomies
species_tree: data/example/species_tree.nwk

### Output folder ###
#####################

# Tag added to output folder name, all results will be stored in the folder SCORPiOs_jobname
# The corrected gene tree forest will be SCORPiOs_example/SCORPiOs_corrected_forest_0.nhx
# .nhx tags are added to corrected trees in the corrected forest:
# leaves of corrected subtrees are marked with a tag "CORR_ID_`WGD`"
# leaves rearranged to regraft subtrees are marked with "MOVED_ID_`WGD`".
jobname: 'example'

##################
### Parameters ###
##################

# Each WGD event in the species tree should be indicated via the name of the ancestor of all duplicated species
# Then, for each WGD, provide one or several outgroup species to use in the synteny analysis
# Any non-duplicated species can be used as outgroup
# Phylogenetically close outgroup should be preferred as synteny with duplicated species will be more conserved
# Multiple outgroups are to be given as a comma-separated list, in priority order
WGDs:
  Clupeocephala: 'Lepisosteus.oculatus,Amia.calva'
  Salmonidae: 'Esox.lucius,Gasterosteus.aculeatus,Oryzias.latipes'

# Whether the average number of syntenic orthologs to include genes in the Orthology Table should be optimized
# ('y') or not ('n')
# default value if the threshold is not optimized is 2.0.
optimize_synteny_support_threshold: 'y'

#Whether phylogenetic orthologs without synteny support should be discarded from the synteny analysis
#('y' or 'n')
filter_otable_nosynteny: 'n'

# Size of the sliding window used in the pairwise synteny analysis
windowSize: 15

# Cut-off on pairwise synteny similarity scores (between 0 and 1)
cutoff: 0

# Whether branch-lengths should be recomputed after corrections ('y') or not ('n').
# 'y' will be forced by SCORPiOs in iterative correction mode
brlength: 'n'

# Species with a poorer assembly quality that should not be used in the synteny analysis
# You should still provide their genes coordinate file
# Comment it out if you want to use all species in the synteny analysis
lowcov_sp: 'data/example/lowcov'

# Whether to ignore tree-synteny inconsistencies when an orthogroup graph community contains only a single gene
# These are poorly-supported WGD duplication nodes
ignoreSingleGeneCom: 'y'

# Whether each individual corrected tree and its non-corrected counterpart should be saved, each in a .nhx files
# This facilitates direct inspection of corrections
save_tmp_trees: 'n'

# Whether more detailed intermediary outputs should be saved
# setting save_subtrees_lktest to 'y' saves, in addtion to files listed in the README:
# constrained tree topologies, profileNJ and treebest synteny-aware trees, and au-tests outputs
save_subtrees_lktest: 'n'

# Iterative-correction related option, (automatically updated by the wrapper `iterate_scorpios.sh`)
# 0 if SCORPiOs is run in simple mode, current iteration otherwise
current_iter: 0

### Running options ###
#######################

# Maximum number of threads (will never use more than this number)
# It will be restricted to the number of threads specified via --cores
ncores: 14

# Memory (--buffer_size) parameter for a bash sort. If decreased, more /tmp space will be used.
buffer_size: 10G

# Use a parallelization scheme specific to large jobs ("y" or "n")
# If many duplicated species (~ >25), the default parallelization scheme is slow in snakemake
# setting `parallel_scheme_large_job` to 'y' will greatly reduce computation time
parallel_scheme_large_job: 'n'

# Optional, to limit RAM usage
# limit number of cores for the branch length recomputing rule (after all corrections)
# Recomputing branch length can be RAM intensive for large trees (SCORPiOs uses treebest pyhml here)
# To use less RAM one may want to reduce the number of parallel jobs
#limit_threads_for_branch_lengths: 37
